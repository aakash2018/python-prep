displays the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
between them.
2. Write a program that calculates the arithmetic mean of two
numbers.
3. Create a program that calculates and displays the arithmetic
mean of three grades entered by the user.
4. Write a program that calculates the geometric mean of three
numbers entered by the user
5. Write a program that calculates the BMI of an individual,
using the formula BMI = weight / height²
6. Create a program that calculates and displays the perimeter
of a circle, prompting the user for the radius.
7. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle from the
radius, using the formula A = πr²
8. Write a program that calculates the delta of a quadratic
 equation (Δ = b² - 4ac)
9. Write a program that calculates the delta of a quadratic
 equation (Δ = b² - 4ac)
10. Write a program that calculates the perimeter and area of a
 triangle, using the formulas P = a + b + c and A = (b * h) / 2,
 where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle and h is the height
 relative to the side B.
11. Write a program that calculates the average velocity of an
 object, using the formula v = Δs/Δt, where v is the average
 velocity, Δs is the space variation, and Δt is the time variation

 moving object, using the formula E = (mv²) / 2, where E is the
 kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity
13. Write a program that calculates the work done by a force
 acting on an object, using the formula T = F * d, where T is the
 work, F is the applied force, and d is the distance traveled by
 the object.
